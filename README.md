## Background 
SDA Bank is a financial institution that provides services for individuals, small to middle market businesses, as well as large corporations. SDA Bank aids with a range of banking, investment management, and other financial and risk management services. This bank employs approximately two-thousand people, and it is committed to providing the best financial advice and support to its members. Currently, SDA Bank has a total of five hundred thousand clients and members.

## Abstract
The SDA Bank has been experiencing a financial loss due to unreliable loan borrowers. In order to help mitigate this financial loss, five classification models were employed. The classification models are as follows: random forest, naive bayes, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and XGBoost logistic regression. Through this project a sufficient model was produced to predict whether a bank client is recommendable or non-recommendable to take out a loan.
## Problem Statement 
The SDA Bank has recently been experiencing a substantial decrease in funds due to unsuitable loan clients that failed to repay their borrowed money on time. In order to address this issue, the bank is trying to identify whether a client is a suitable candidate for a loan. The bank will carry out this process through the utilization of classification models that will help predict whether an individual may be a good candidate for a loan by using various predictors. This is an important task for the company to address as loans provide another stream of income to the bank through the interest that borrowers are required to pay to the bank. Having unsuitable loan borrowers can significantly impact the bank’s abilities to successfully increase its funds and provide loans for other potential borrowers.
## Goals
Three main goals were determined for the purposes of this project. The three goals are as follows: (1) create a classification-based machine learning algorithm to determine whether a client will be a good loan investment or not, (2) determine specific attributes that indicate whether a client will be a good loan investment, and (3) help lower the risk of investing in candidates that are not able to pay back their loans. This will then help increase the overall profits of the bank.  
## Non-Goals
In order to ensure that this project would remain focused and thorough throughout the course of this analysis, three non-goals were also determined. The three non-goals for this project are as follows: (1) this project will not be used to determine which clients would be good to target for loan marketing, (2) this project will not be looking into what factors may prevent a person from being a good candidate for loan borrowing, and (3) this project will not be used as a way to blacklist clients who currently are not good candidates for borrowing loans. 
## Data Sources 
The data was sourced from CTU Prague Relational Learning Repository. From the relational database, titled “Finance”, the following four datasets were chosen for this project: trans.csv, trans_2.csv, account.csv, and loan.csv.
